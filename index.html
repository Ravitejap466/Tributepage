            <p class="bio-para">Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, often referred to as "APJ Abdul Kalam," was an Indian scientist, engineer, and statesman who played a prominent role in India's space and missile development programs. He was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, and passed away on July 27, 2015.

				Kalam is best known for his work as a space scientist and his contributions to India's civilian space program. He played a pivotal role in the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III) and was instrumental in the success of India's first satellite, "Rohini-1." He also played a key role in the development of ballistic missile technology, particularly the Agni and Prithvi missile systems.
				
				In 2002, Abdul Kalam became the 11th President of India, serving in the position until 2007. He was widely regarded as the "People's President" due to his humble and approachable nature. During his presidency, he continued to emphasize the importance of education, scientific research, and technological development.
				
				Dr. Kalam was also an advocate for youth empowerment and education. He was passionate about inspiring and mentoring young minds, often speaking at schools and colleges to encourage students to pursue careers in science and technology. He authored several books, including "Wings of Fire," an autobiography that detailed his early life, education, and contributions to India's space and missile programs.
